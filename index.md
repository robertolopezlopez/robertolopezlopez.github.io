This is my personal website.

I am a programming enthusiast and software engineer with focus on backend and cloud - doing self hosting just for fun. Currently I use Python and AWS at work, but in reality I am a gopher enthusiast. Based in Krak√≥w, Poland.

I enjoy mechanical keyboards, science fiction books and John Carpenter movies.
