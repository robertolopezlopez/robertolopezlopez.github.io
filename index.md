This is my personal website. I will just add here some links.

* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertolopezlopez/).

I am a software engineer, programming enthusiast with focus on backend[^1] and cloud[^2]. Currently using Python and AWS at work[^3]. Based in Krak√≥w, Poland.

[^1] Do not even try to sell me any frontend related task, please.

[^2] I enjoy tinkering with self hosting as well. Who doesn't nowadays? Back to your monolith!

[^3] But in reality, I am a gopher enthusiast.
