I am a software engineer, programming enthusiast with focus on backend[^3] and cloud[^2]. Currently using Python and AWS at work[^1]. Based in Krak√≥w, Poland.

[^1] But in reality, I am a gopher enthusiast.

[^2] I enjoy tinkering with self hosting as well. Who doesn't nowadays? Back to your monolith!

[^3] Do not even try to sell me any frontend related task, please.
